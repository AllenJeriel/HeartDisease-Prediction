Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the critical need for accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, for predicting cardiac disease risk. Leveraging the Heart Disease Cleveland dataset, we employ Random Forest in conjunction with GridSearchCV, a hyperparameter tuning technique, to optimize the model's performance. The dataset comprises comprehensive information on various clinical and demographic features, providing a rich source for predictive modeling. Our approach involves preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare it for the Random Forest classifier. GridSearchCV is employed to systematically search through hyperparameter combinations, fine-tuning the model to achieve optimal predictive accuracy. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are employed to assess the model's performance on both training and testing datasets. Results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting cardiac disease risk, showcasing the potential for machine learning to assist in early diagnosis and risk stratification.
